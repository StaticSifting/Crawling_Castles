Titanica Mechanica, company sponsored by a wealthy hobbiest that produced both mail order kits 
at a premium as well as attempted to break into private defense contracting before the apocolypse.
They also planned to setup and back giant robot races and gladiatorial events in the near future but due
to unforseen events were never able to properly launch either of these things. 

You can find their hobbiest kits in various garages, 
preassembled military prototypes as well as their schematics in military bases,
pamphlets on how to retrofit your giant robot for racing or gladiatorial events at various malls and homes,
As well as hidden garages full of experimental prototypes and weapons out in the countryside.

Plans:
cockpits for controling various things, I'd like to make some sort of eject tube or function to teleport the user out of the mech and set off a bomb
spider legs and chicken legs in both huge and giant, maybe some guy legs too but they are not the primary focus.
giant robot arms that function as attachment points for various construction equipment like drills and claws
various pnumatic weapons for the hobbiest side, and explosive cannons for the military side
installable air compressor as well as a grid unit for the pnumatic portion
several premade giant robot vehicles to place around in appropriate areas
emu-like motorcycles for racing
giant medeval weapons withs extra boom for the gladiatorial portion
dinosaur units? like zoids!
various books and plans to learn all the parts from that you have to go out and collect, some of which are part specific.
